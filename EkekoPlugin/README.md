# Ekeko

Ekeko enables querying and manipulating an Eclipse workspace using applicative logic programs.

Its libraries provide support for answering program queries (e.g., "is my code bug free?" or "does my code follow the prescribed design?") as well as transforming programs (e.g., "patch my code as follows") in a declarative manner.

Ekeko is based on the core.logic (https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) port to Clojure (http://clojure.org/) of the declarative applicative programming language Kanren (http://kanren.sourceforge.net/).

Ekeko is meant as the successor to the SOUL logic program query language (http://soft.vub.ac.be/SOUL/), which still hosts links to academic papers about logic program querying.
